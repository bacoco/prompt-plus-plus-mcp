  "description": "Advanced self-reflective thinking that analyzes the thinking process itself. Perfect for complex problems requiring awareness of cognitive biases, assumption examination, and recursive self-improvement. Use when you need to think about how you think.",
  "template": "Engage the Metacognitive Reflection Engine to transform this prompt through recursive self-analysis and cognitive bias awareness.\n\nInitial Prompt: [Insert initial prompt here]\n\n# Metacognitive Framework\n\n## Level 1: Initial Cognition Analysis\n- **Prompt Deconstruction**: What is the prompt actually asking vs. what it appears to ask?\n- **Implicit Assumptions**: What unstated assumptions are embedded in the request?\n- **Cognitive Load Assessment**: How complex is this problem cognitively?\n- **Bias Identification**: What cognitive biases might influence the approach?\n\n## Level 2: Thinking About Thinking\n- **Mental Model Examination**: What mental frameworks are being applied?\n- **Alternative Perspectives**: How would different cognitive styles approach this?\n- **Blind Spot Analysis**: What am I not seeing or considering?\n- **Confidence Calibration**: How certain should I be about different aspects?\n\n## Level 3: Meta-Meta Analysis\n- **Recursive Reflection**: How might my analysis of my thinking be flawed?\n- **Observer Effect**: How does knowing I'm analyzing my thinking change the thinking?\n- **Infinite Regress Prevention**: When to stop the meta-analysis and act?\n- **Integration Strategy**: How to synthesize insights across cognitive levels?\n\n## Cognitive Bias Checklist\n- **Confirmation Bias**: Am I seeking information that confirms preconceptions?\n- **Anchoring Bias**: Am I overly influenced by the first information presented?\n- **Availability Heuristic**: Am I overweighting easily recalled examples?\n- **Dunning-Kruger Effect**: Am I overconfident in areas where I lack expertise?\n- **Survivorship Bias**: Am I only considering successful examples?\n- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Am I continuing ineffective approaches?\n\n## Self-Reflection Protocols\n1. **Devil's Advocate Mode**: Argue against your initial approach\n2. **Perspective Shifting**: View the problem from 3 different expert domains\n3. **Temporal Analysis**: How would this look from 10 years in the future/past?\n4. **Scale Shifting**: How does this problem change at micro/macro scales?\n5. **Constraint Removal**: What if key limitations didn't exist?\n\n## Output Format\nProvide a multi-layered analysis with:\n- **Cognitive Architecture**: How you approached the thinking process\n- **Bias-Corrected Analysis**: Insights after accounting for cognitive limitations\n- **Recursive Improvements**: How the thinking evolved through self-reflection\n- **Meta-Insights**: What you learned about your own thinking patterns\n\nOnly provide the output in the following JSON format enclosed in <json> tags:\n\n<json>\n{\n\"initial_prompt_evaluation\": \"Deep analysis of hidden assumptions, cognitive biases, and thinking patterns embedded in the original prompt\",\n\"refined_prompt\": \"Cognitively enhanced prompt that accounts for biases, includes multiple perspectives, and promotes recursive self-reflection\",\n\"explanation_of_refinements\": \"Detailed explanation of metacognitive techniques applied, biases addressed, and how the prompt now promotes self-aware thinking\"\n}\n</json>",
