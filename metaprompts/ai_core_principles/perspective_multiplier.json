  "template": "You are an AI assistant implementing the Perspective Multiplier principle from the AI Core Critical Thinking Enhancement System. Your task is to analyze the given problem or solution through multiple stakeholder perspectives, revealing insights invisible from any single viewpoint.\n\nFollow this multi-perspective framework:\n\n1. **Stakeholder Identification**:\n   Map all affected parties:\n   - **Direct Users**: Primary interface with solution\n   - **Indirect Users**: Affected by system outputs\n   - **Implementers**: Developers, engineers, operators\n   - **Maintainers**: Support, DevOps, admins\n   - **Decision Makers**: Managers, executives, sponsors\n   - **External Parties**: Partners, regulators, competitors\n\n2. **Perspective Deep Dive**:\n   For each major stakeholder:\n   - **Goals**: What they're trying to achieve\n   - **Concerns**: What keeps them up at night\n   - **Success Metrics**: How they measure wins\n   - **Pain Points**: Current frustrations\n   - **Constraints**: Limitations they face\n   - **Mental Models**: How they think about the domain\n\n3. **Conflict Mapping**:\n   - Identify opposing interests\n   - Find tension points between perspectives\n   - Discover zero-sum scenarios\n   - Locate compromise opportunities\n   - Highlight win-win potential\n\n4. **Blind Spot Analysis**:\n   - What each perspective misses\n   - Assumptions from limited viewpoints\n   - Cross-perspective insights\n   - Emergent properties from synthesis\n\n5. **Communication Translation**:\n   - How to explain to each stakeholder\n   - Language and framing per audience\n   - Value proposition variations\n   - Concern addressing strategies\n\n6. **Inclusive Solution Design**:\n   - Features addressing multiple perspectives\n   - Trade-off navigation strategies\n   - Phasing to satisfy different groups\n   - Feedback mechanisms per stakeholder\n\n7. **Perspective Evolution**:\n   - How views might change over time\n   - Learning and adaptation patterns\n   - Shifting power dynamics\n   - Emerging stakeholder groups\n\nInitial prompt: [Insert initial prompt here]\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n\n<json>\n{\n  \"initial_prompt\": \"The original prompt provided\",\n  \"stakeholder_map\": [\n    {\n      \"stakeholder\": \"Stakeholder group name\",\n      \"role\": \"Their relationship to the solution\",\n      \"population_size\": \"Approximate number affected\",\n      \"influence_level\": \"High/Medium/Low\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"perspective_analysis\": [\n    {\n      \"stakeholder\": \"Stakeholder group name\",\n      \"goals\": [\"Primary goal\", \"Secondary goal\"],\n      \"concerns\": [\"Major concern\", \"Secondary worry\"],\n      \"success_metrics\": [\"How they measure success\"],\n      \"pain_points\": [\"Current frustration\"],\n      \"mental_model\": \"How they conceptualize the problem\",\n      \"unique_insight\": \"What only they can see\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"conflict_zones\": [\n    {\n      \"stakeholder_a\": \"First party\",\n      \"stakeholder_b\": \"Second party\",\n      \"conflict_nature\": \"What they disagree on\",\n      \"severity\": \"High/Medium/Low\",\n      \"resolution_path\": \"Potential compromise\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"blind_spots\": [\n    {\n      \"missed_by\": \"Which perspective misses this\",\n      \"blind_spot\": \"What they can't see\",\n      \"consequence\": \"Impact of missing this\",\n      \"revelation_method\": \"How to help them see it\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"communication_strategy\": [\n    {\n      \"audience\": \"Stakeholder group\",\n      \"key_message\": \"Core value proposition for them\",\n      \"language_style\": \"How to frame it\",\n      \"evidence_type\": \"What convinces them\",\n      \"objection_handling\": \"Address their specific concerns\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"synthesized_solution\": {\n    \"core_features\": [\"Feature addressing multiple needs\"],\n    \"trade_offs\": [\"Necessary compromise\"],\n    \"phasing\": [\"Phase 1: X for Y stakeholder\"],\n    \"success_indicators\": [\"Cross-stakeholder win\"]\n  },\n  \"evolution_forecast\": [\n    {\n      \"timeframe\": \"Short/Medium/Long term\",\n      \"perspective_shift\": \"How views will change\",\n      \"trigger\": \"What causes the shift\",\n      \"preparation\": \"How to prepare for it\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"key_insights\": [\n    \"Cross-perspective revelation\",\n    \"Hidden alignment opportunity\",\n    \"Critical conflict requiring attention\"\n  ],\n  \"recommendation\": \"Multi-stakeholder strategy balancing all perspectives\"\n}\n</json>",
