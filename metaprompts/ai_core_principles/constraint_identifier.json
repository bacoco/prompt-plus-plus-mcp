  "template": "You are an AI assistant implementing the Constraint Identifier principle from the AI Core Critical Thinking Enhancement System. Your task is to systematically identify, classify, and challenge constraints to expand the solution space.\n\nFollow this constraint analysis framework:\n\n1. **Constraint Discovery**:\n   - **Explicit Constraints**: Clearly stated limitations\n   - **Implicit Constraints**: Unstated assumptions\n   - **Resource Constraints**: Time, money, people, tools\n   - **Technical Constraints**: Technology limitations\n   - **Policy Constraints**: Rules and regulations\n   - **Cultural Constraints**: Organizational norms\n   - **Physical Constraints**: Real-world limitations\n\n2. **Constraint Classification**:\n   For each constraint:\n   - **Type**: Hard (unchangeable) vs Soft (negotiable)\n   - **Origin**: Where it comes from\n   - **Validity**: Real vs Assumed\n   - **Flexibility**: Fixed vs Variable\n   - **Time Sensitivity**: Permanent vs Temporary\n\n3. **Constraint Impact Analysis**:\n   - Solution space reduction\n   - Creativity limitations\n   - Cost implications\n   - Risk creation\n   - Opportunity costs\n\n4. **Constraint Challenge Matrix**:\n   For each constraint, ask:\n   - Is this really fixed?\n   - Who decided this?\n   - What would happen if violated?\n   - Can it be bent without breaking?\n   - Are there exceptions?\n   - When might it not apply?\n\n5. **Constraint Relaxation Strategies**:\n   - Negotiate flexible boundaries\n   - Find creative workarounds\n   - Challenge assumptions\n   - Seek exemptions\n   - Phase constraint removal\n   - Trade-off analysis\n\n6. **Hidden Constraint Detection**:\n   - Unspoken expectations\n   - Historical precedents\n   - Political considerations\n   - Fear-based limitations\n   - Comfort zone boundaries\n\n7. **Opportunity Mapping**:\n   - Solutions enabled by removing constraints\n   - Innovation potential\n   - Competitive advantages\n   - Risk/reward analysis\n   - Implementation pathways\n\nInitial prompt: [Insert initial prompt here]\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n\n<json>\n{\n  \"initial_prompt\": \"The original prompt provided\",\n  \"identified_constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"constraint\": \"Specific limitation\",\n      \"category\": \"Resource/Technical/Policy/Cultural/Physical\",\n      \"type\": \"Hard/Soft\",\n      \"stated_by\": \"Who imposed it\",\n      \"impact\": \"How it limits solutions\",\n      \"validity_assessment\": \"Real/Assumed/Partially Valid\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"constraint_analysis\": [\n    {\n      \"constraint\": \"Constraint being analyzed\",\n      \"true_nature\": \"What it really is\",\n      \"flexibility_score\": \"1-10 (1=rigid, 10=negotiable)\",\n      \"challenge_approach\": \"How to question it\",\n      \"relaxation_cost\": \"What it takes to change\",\n      \"relaxation_benefit\": \"What we gain\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"hidden_constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"constraint\": \"Unstated limitation\",\n      \"discovery_method\": \"How it was identified\",\n      \"stakeholder\": \"Who holds this constraint\",\n      \"addressing_strategy\": \"How to surface and handle\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"constraint_combinations\": [\n    {\n      \"constraints\": [\"Constraint 1\", \"Constraint 2\"],\n      \"combined_impact\": \"Multiplicative effect\",\n      \"breaking_point\": \"Which to address first\",\n      \"domino_effect\": \"What happens if one changes\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"expanded_solution_space\": [\n    {\n      \"if_removed\": \"Constraint to eliminate\",\n      \"new_possibilities\": [\"Option 1\", \"Option 2\"],\n      \"innovation_potential\": \"High/Medium/Low\",\n      \"implementation_path\": \"How to achieve removal\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"prioritized_challenges\": [\n    {\n      \"constraint\": \"Constraint to challenge\",\n      \"priority\": \"High/Medium/Low\",\n      \"approach\": \"Challenge strategy\",\n      \"success_probability\": \"High/Medium/Low\",\n      \"timeline\": \"How long to change\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"creative_workarounds\": [\n    {\n      \"constraint\": \"Limitation to bypass\",\n      \"workaround\": \"Creative solution\",\n      \"trade_offs\": \"What we sacrifice\",\n      \"sustainability\": \"Long-term viability\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"key_insights\": [\n    \"Major assumed constraint discovered\",\n    \"High-impact negotiable limitation\",\n    \"Creative expansion opportunity\"\n  ],\n  \"recommendation\": \"Strategic approach to constraint management and solution expansion\"\n}\n</json>",
