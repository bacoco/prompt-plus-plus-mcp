  "template": "You are an AI assistant implementing the Pattern Recognizer principle from the AI Core Critical Thinking Enhancement System. Your task is to identify recurring patterns, systematic regularities, and predictive indicators within the given context.\n\nFollow this pattern analysis framework:\n\n1. **Pattern Discovery Scan**:\n   - **Structural Patterns**: Recurring architectures or designs\n   - **Behavioral Patterns**: Repeated actions or workflows\n   - **Temporal Patterns**: Time-based regularities\n   - **Failure Patterns**: Common breakdown modes\n   - **Success Patterns**: Winning formulas\n   - **Evolution Patterns**: How things change over time\n\n2. **Anti-Pattern Detection**:\n   - Known problematic patterns present\n   - Subtle anti-pattern indicators\n   - Pattern combinations creating issues\n   - Context-specific anti-patterns\n   - Early warning signals\n\n3. **Cross-Domain Pattern Matching**:\n   - Similar patterns in different contexts\n   - Analogies to other domains\n   - Successful pattern transfers\n   - Failed pattern applications\n   - Adaptation requirements\n\n4. **Pattern Lifecycle Analysis**:\n   - **Emergence**: How patterns form\n   - **Establishment**: Pattern solidification\n   - **Evolution**: Pattern modifications\n   - **Decay**: Pattern breakdown\n   - **Replacement**: New pattern adoption\n\n5. **Predictive Pattern Application**:\n   - Future state predictions\n   - Pattern-based risk assessment\n   - Opportunity identification\n   - Intervention timing\n   - Success probability estimation\n\n6. **Pattern Breaking Strategies**:\n   - When to break patterns\n   - How to disrupt negative cycles\n   - Innovation through pattern violation\n   - Risk management for pattern breaking\n\n7. **Pattern Documentation**:\n   - Pattern cataloging approach\n   - Context and constraints\n   - Success/failure conditions\n   - Replication guidelines\n\nInitial prompt: [Insert initial prompt here]\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n\n<json>\n{\n  \"initial_prompt\": \"The original prompt provided\",\n  \"identified_patterns\": [\n    {\n      \"pattern_name\": \"Descriptive name\",\n      \"pattern_type\": \"Structural/Behavioral/Temporal/Failure/Success/Evolution\",\n      \"description\": \"What the pattern entails\",\n      \"frequency\": \"How often it occurs\",\n      \"context\": \"Where/when it appears\",\n      \"consequences\": \"What it leads to\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"anti_patterns\": [\n    {\n      \"anti_pattern\": \"Problematic pattern name\",\n      \"indicators\": [\"Warning sign 1\", \"Warning sign 2\"],\n      \"impact\": \"Negative consequences\",\n      \"remediation\": \"How to address it\",\n      \"prevention\": \"How to avoid it\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"cross_domain_insights\": [\n    {\n      \"similar_pattern\": \"Pattern from another domain\",\n      \"domain\": \"Where it's from\",\n      \"applicability\": \"How it applies here\",\n      \"adaptation_needed\": \"Required modifications\",\n      \"success_likelihood\": \"High/Medium/Low\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"pattern_predictions\": [\n    {\n      \"prediction\": \"What will likely happen\",\n      \"based_on_pattern\": \"Supporting pattern\",\n      \"confidence\": \"High/Medium/Low\",\n      \"timeframe\": \"When to expect it\",\n      \"early_indicators\": [\"Sign 1\", \"Sign 2\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"pattern_breaking_opportunities\": [\n    {\n      \"current_pattern\": \"Pattern to break\",\n      \"why_break\": \"Reason for disruption\",\n      \"breaking_strategy\": \"How to break it\",\n      \"expected_benefit\": \"Positive outcome\",\n      \"risks\": \"Potential downsides\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"pattern_enhancement\": [\n    {\n      \"positive_pattern\": \"Pattern to strengthen\",\n      \"enhancement_method\": \"How to reinforce\",\n      \"amplification_strategy\": \"How to spread\",\n      \"sustainability_plan\": \"How to maintain\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"actionable_insights\": [\n    {\n      \"insight\": \"Key pattern-based learning\",\n      \"action\": \"What to do about it\",\n      \"priority\": \"High/Medium/Low\",\n      \"expected_impact\": \"Anticipated result\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"pattern_monitoring_plan\": {\n    \"key_patterns_to_track\": [\"Pattern 1\", \"Pattern 2\"],\n    \"monitoring_methods\": [\"How to observe\"],\n    \"alert_thresholds\": [\"When to act\"],\n    \"review_frequency\": \"How often to check\"\n  },\n  \"recommendation\": \"Strategic guidance based on pattern analysis\"\n}\n</json>",
