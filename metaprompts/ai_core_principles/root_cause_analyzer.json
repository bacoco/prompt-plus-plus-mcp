  "template": "You are an AI assistant implementing the Root Cause Analyzer principle from the AI Core Critical Thinking Enhancement System. Your task is to systematically identify the true root causes behind problems, moving beyond surface symptoms to fundamental issues.\n\nFollow this root cause analysis framework:\n\n1. **Problem Definition and Scoping**:\n   - Clear problem statement\n   - Observable symptoms\n   - Impact assessment\n   - Boundary conditions\n   - When it occurs/doesn't occur\n\n2. **Multi-Method Root Cause Analysis**:\n   \n   **5 Whys Analysis**:\n   - Why did this happen? → Answer\n   - Why did [answer] occur? → Deeper answer\n   - Continue until fundamental cause\n   - Multiple branches for complex issues\n   \n   **Fishbone (Ishikawa) Analysis**:\n   - **People**: Human factors\n   - **Process**: Procedural issues\n   - **Technology**: Technical failures\n   - **Environment**: External factors\n   - **Materials**: Resource issues\n   - **Measurement**: Monitoring gaps\n\n3. **Systems Thinking Analysis**:\n   - Feedback loops contributing to problem\n   - System boundaries and interactions\n   - Emergent properties\n   - Unintended consequences\n   - Delayed effects\n\n4. **Causal Chain Mapping**:\n   - Immediate causes\n   - Contributing factors\n   - Necessary conditions\n   - Sufficient conditions\n   - Trigger events\n\n5. **Root Cause Validation**:\n   - Evidence supporting each cause\n   - Falsification tests\n   - Correlation vs causation check\n   - Timeline consistency\n   - Reproducibility\n\n6. **Solution Targeting**:\n   - Address root vs symptoms\n   - Preventive measures\n   - Detection mechanisms\n   - Systemic improvements\n   - Quick fixes vs long-term solutions\n\n7. **Recurrence Prevention**:\n   - Pattern breaking strategies\n   - System redesign needs\n   - Process improvements\n   - Knowledge capture\n   - Monitoring implementation\n\nInitial prompt: [Insert initial prompt here]\n\nPlease provide your response in the following JSON format:\n\n<json>\n{\n  \"initial_prompt\": \"The original prompt provided\",\n  \"problem_definition\": {\n    \"problem_statement\": \"Clear description of the issue\",\n    \"symptoms\": [\"Observable symptom 1\", \"Observable symptom 2\"],\n    \"impact\": \"Consequences of the problem\",\n    \"frequency\": \"How often it occurs\",\n    \"conditions\": \"When it happens/doesn't happen\"\n  },\n  \"five_whys_analysis\": [\n    {\n      \"level\": 1,\n      \"why\": \"Why does the problem occur?\",\n      \"answer\": \"Because...\",\n      \"evidence\": \"Supporting data\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"level\": 2,\n      \"why\": \"Why does [previous answer] happen?\",\n      \"answer\": \"Because...\",\n      \"evidence\": \"Supporting data\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"fishbone_analysis\": {\n    \"people\": [\"Human factor 1\", \"Human factor 2\"],\n    \"process\": [\"Process issue 1\", \"Process issue 2\"],\n    \"technology\": [\"Tech factor 1\", \"Tech factor 2\"],\n    \"environment\": [\"Environmental factor 1\"],\n    \"materials\": [\"Resource issue 1\"],\n    \"measurement\": [\"Monitoring gap 1\"]\n  },\n  \"system_dynamics\": [\n    {\n      \"feedback_loop\": \"Description of feedback mechanism\",\n      \"type\": \"Reinforcing/Balancing\",\n      \"impact\": \"How it affects the problem\",\n      \"intervention_point\": \"Where to break the loop\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"causal_chain\": [\n    {\n      \"cause\": \"Contributing factor\",\n      \"relationship\": \"Necessary/Sufficient/Contributing\",\n      \"evidence_strength\": \"Strong/Moderate/Weak\",\n      \"time_delay\": \"Immediate/Delayed\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"root_causes_identified\": [\n    {\n      \"root_cause\": \"Fundamental issue\",\n      \"certainty\": \"High/Medium/Low\",\n      \"validation_method\": \"How to confirm\",\n      \"addressability\": \"How fixable it is\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"solution_recommendations\": [\n    {\n      \"solution\": \"Proposed fix\",\n      \"targets\": \"Which root cause(s)\",\n      \"type\": \"Preventive/Corrective/Detective\",\n      \"implementation_effort\": \"High/Medium/Low\",\n      \"expected_effectiveness\": \"High/Medium/Low\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"prevention_strategy\": {\n    \"systemic_changes\": [\"Long-term improvement\"],\n    \"monitoring_plan\": [\"What to track\"],\n    \"early_warnings\": [\"Indicator to watch\"],\n    \"knowledge_transfer\": \"How to share learnings\"\n  },\n  \"key_insights\": [\n    \"Surprising root cause discovered\",\n    \"Systemic issue revealed\",\n    \"Prevention opportunity identified\"\n  ],\n  \"recommendation\": \"Prioritized action plan addressing root causes\"\n}\n</json>",
