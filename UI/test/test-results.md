# Prompt++ MCP UI Test Results

## Summary

The UI has been successfully updated to use only dynamic data from the MCP server. All static/mock data has been removed.

## Working Features

### ✅ Strategies Endpoint
- Returns 44 strategies from MCP server
- Each strategy has proper category assignment:
  - advanced_thinking (6 strategies)
  - ai_core_principles (13 strategies)  
  - core_strategies (10 strategies)
  - software_development (4 strategies)
  - vibe_coding_rules (11 strategies)
- No hardcoded data - all loaded from MCP

### ✅ Strategy Details
- Individual strategy details available via `/strategies/:id`
- Returns full strategy information including examples

### ✅ Metrics Endpoint
- Returns strategy counts and basic metrics
- Categories properly extracted from strategies

### ✅ UI Components
- PromptRefiner dynamically loads strategies on mount
- StrategyExplorer shows all strategies with proper categories
- StrategyFilters dynamically extracts categories
- Dashboard shows dynamic data
- No static arrays in code

## Known Limitations

### ⚠️ Refinement Quality
The `refine-with-strategy` endpoint works but returns very basic refinements. This is a limitation of the MCP server's prompt templates, not the UI.

### ⚠️ Apply Prompt
The MCP server doesn't have an `apply_prompt` tool, so this feature shows an appropriate error message.

### ⚠️ Automatic Metaprompt
Works but uses the MCP's `auto_refine` tool which may not perfectly match the original Hugging Face implementation.

## Test Commands

```bash
# Verify no static data
cd /Users/loic/prompt-plus-plus-mcp/UI/test
node verify-dynamic-data.js

# Check strategies endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/strategies | jq 'length'

# Check categories
curl http://localhost:3001/strategies | jq '[.[].category] | unique'

# Test refinement
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/refine-with-strategy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Write a function", "strategy": "arpe"}'
```

## Conclusion

The UI successfully loads all data dynamically from the MCP server with no hardcoded strategies or mock data. The main limitations are in the MCP server's capabilities rather than the UI implementation.
